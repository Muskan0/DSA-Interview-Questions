'''
Time Complexity: It takes O(m) preprocessing time, 
and its matching time is O((n-m+1)*m) in the worst case,
where m is the size of the pattern and
n is the size of the text.
In average case, we expect few valid shiftsâ€”perhaps some 
constant c of them. In this case, the expected matching time
of the algorithm is O((n-m+1)+ cm), plus the time required 
to process spurious hits.
